# Chat-app

## introduction

In this project I created a Chat-app using React.js as my front-end framework and Firebase service as my back-end and database technology.

The main purpose of this project is learning to work with unknown sevice and his utilities - like Firebase.

The services I used from Firebase are Authentication - for authenticate the user, Firestore Database - as noSQL database, storage - to store user profile images, and Hosting to upload the appliction online - [link](https://chat-app-4d700.web.app/)
